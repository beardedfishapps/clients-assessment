# Clients Application Assessment

For this application, I focused on simplicity and clean UI. The design choices were intended to make the colors pop but remain pleasant to view. I am colorblind so my design choices may not be the most appealing to everyone but that's why we work on teams to design applications!

As with everything with front-end development, I worked to make sure that the application was accessible. With this application specifically, I was simply striving for 100% on the Lighthouse ranking. There are places where I could have added aria tags, like where the modal opens, to alert a disabled user of state changes to the page.

Another choice I could have made but didn't see a strong benefit to doing it, though if this was a larger scale application I would have, is making the `dialog` a standalone component.
